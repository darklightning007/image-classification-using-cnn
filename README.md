# 🐶🐱 Image Classification using CNN – Dog vs Cat Classifier
## Overview
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of dogs and cats. The model was trained using a dataset of labeled images to achieve more than 90% accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes. Once trained, the model can accurately predict whether a new, unseen image contains a dog or a cat.
